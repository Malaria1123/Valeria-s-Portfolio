        <h1>Planned Parenthood Generation Action (UM)</h1>
            <h4>November 2025</h3>
        <li>Planned Parenthood Generation Action is a club that advocates for female reproductive health. I was loosely
            involved with the club this past term but will be more active in the next terms to come. This club is very
            meaningful to me because gynecology is the specialty I want to find a career in as a doctor. In this club, we
            do tabling to raise awareness, hand out free products (merchandise and reproductive health products) to students at 
            the University of Miami and host events for the students to get involved. Some of these events include trivia 
            nights and care package packing events. This club helped me find amazing people to connect with after a rough 
            transition into the University of Miami as a transfer student.<br>

        <h1>Alternative Breaks (UM)</h1>
            <h4>September 2025 - December 2025</h3>
        <li>Alternative Breaks is an organization that takes their members on a short service trip during one of their breaks. I went to Martin County, Florida
            during the fall break of 2025. More information about the trip and what I learned during it is available on the
            <a href="volunteer.html">volunteering</a> page. Outside of this trip, we had a meeting in October
            2025. This organization taught me independence, leadership, and how to better communicate with all types of people. <br>

        <h1>Init (FIU)</h1>
            <h4>January 2025 - April 2025</h3>
        <li>Init is an organization that teaches a general audience how to get started in coding. 
            At Init I learned basic techniques. Init is where I learned how to create this CV. We learned how to use HTML, CSS, and Javascript
            on a basic level. We did two projects over the spring 2025 term. The first one was a Spotify Data Visualizer using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
            The second one was creating a personal portfolio (this website) using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
            I am adding more to this portfolio by using what I learned in the workshops. With Init, I was also introduced to the world
            of technology and software engineering. I went to Women in Tech Conference 2025 (Witcon) and Demonstration Day for spring 2025.
            This showed me how computer science can be useful in a variety of areas and not strictly for software engineers.<br>

        <li>Alternative Breaks is an organization that takes their members on a short service trip during one of their breaks. I went to Tampa, Florida
            during the winter break of 2024. More information about the trip is available on the
            <a href="volunteer.html">volunteering</a> page. Outside of this trip, we had biweekly meetings from October
            2024 to March 2025. This organization taught us teamwork, responsibility, and leadership.<br>

        <h1>American Medical Student Association (FIU)</h1>
            <h4>August 2024 - December 2024</h3>
        <li>I was the most active member of pre-med AMSA for the fall 2024 term at Florida International University. At AMSA, students have 
            the opportunity to get community service hours, donate to various causes, attend countless medical school application events, 
            and get hands on experience with many medical trainings. I attended a phlebotomy workshop, a CPR workshop, a manual vacuum respiration
            workshop, a suturing workshop, and many other types of introductory training. The more events attended, the more points the members got. 
            I was a gold distinction member (the highest level recognized) with over 50 points for the term. This organization introduced me to so many
            medical experiences, showed me several opportunities for pursing medicine and helped me give back to the community from school.<br>
