        <li class="desc3">Being a part of Alternative Breaks, I had to go on a weekend trip to volunteer in Tampa. More information
            about Alternative Breaks is available on the <a href="clubs.html">organizations</a> page. On this trip
            we went to Tampa Florida from December 15, 2024 to December 18, 2024. On the 15th we explored Tampa. 
            On the 16th, we volunteered with The Samaritans Purse. We helped make a womans house livable after Being
            devistated by Hurricane Milton. This experience helped me learn that if I am more fortunate than others, 
            it does not take a lot of effort to help others who are not as fortunate. On the 17th, we volunteered with
            The Salvation Army. We helped prepare gifts for underprivlaged families. This experience helped me learn that
            I do not have to spend any money just to help people who do not have disposable cash. Spending money
            seems to hold people back from helping in their community, but it does not have to cost a single cent.

        <h1>Cards for Kids</h1>
            <h4>Hours: 6</h3>
        <li>In the American Medical Student Assosiation (AMSA) we had the oppurtunity to create cards for 
            terminally ill hospitalized children. This experience was honestly very touching. Not just because
            I knew the children would be happy to recieve a card, but also because I knew their family would 
            cherish the moments they spent with their child recieving their card. This encouraged me to put in 
            real effort and creativity for a child I did not even know. I hope to do this more often in the future.
