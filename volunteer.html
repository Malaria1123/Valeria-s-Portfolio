        <h1 class="title3">Alternative Breaks (UM)</h1>
            <h4 class="date3">Hours: 32</h3>
        <li class="desc3">On my second Alternative Breaks trip I volunteered with Habitat for Humanity Restore. This was in 
            Martin County, Florida from October 11, 2025, to October 14, 2025. More information
            about Alternative Breaks is available on the <a href="clubs.html">clubs</a> page. On this trip, 
            I was a <b>site leader</b>. This means I spoke for the group, gave the group direction, and helped create plans 
            for how we went about each day. During our trip, the Habitat for Humanity Restore was moving to a new location. We spent the whole
            trip helping with their move. <br>On day one, we helped tear down old furniture in the new location to make room for the 
            new furniture. This included breaking cabinets and dumping rubble. On day one, I broke my nail, and it hurt really badly. 
            I did not let that impact my availability to help throughout the trip. <br>On day two, Habitat for Humanity Restore was closed.
            On this day off, the group did a beach cleanup. <br>On day three, we helped to load many boxes onto a moving truck from 
            the old location. This was a great team effort since the boxes were heavy and plentiful. We split into two groups.
            One group was loading boxes onto a dolly, and the other group was pushing the dolly and loading the boxes
            onto the moving truck. Later that same day, we went to a sea turtle hospital called Loggerhead Marinelife 
            Center. This was thanks to one of my group members who works there, Caitlin.<br>On day four, we helped to unload the moving truck full of boxes to the new location. This was 
            also a team effort. It required us to split into two groups again. One group had people loading the boxes
            onto a dolly, and another group pushing the dolly and unloading the boxes in the new location. 
            <br> <br>
            Throughout this experience, my group learned a lot about each other. This was most of my group's first
            Alternative Breaks trip. I got to tell them about my experience on my previous trip. I also learned about where
            the other members are from and what they aspire to do in the future. Working in groups meant that the hard work 
            was not only done more efficiently, but more fun as well. Besides the group members, we also met great people in 
            Martin County. The construction manager, Jeff, was so kind throughout our trip. When I hurt my nail, he took great
            care to ensure that I was okay. I spoke with many employees, and they all had unique stories to tell about themselves.
            This trip taught me a lot in such a short amount of time. I learned leadership as a site leader. I learned independence
            after hurting myself while so far away from home and relying on myself to remain composed and collected as a site 
            leader. I learned to have confidence when speaking for a group and when speaking to new people. I also learned
            that there is inherent value in branching out and meeting new people. Meeting Caitlin made it possible to 
            visit the sea turtle hospital.<br>

        <li class="desc3">I volunteer at Nicklaus Children's Hospital once a week for three hours. I volunteer in the
            pathology lab. I help file glass sample slides, plastic sample blocks, and papers. I also help create and 
            stain glass sample slides. On some occasions, I can shadow certain specimen extraction procedures and dissection
            of organs. <br>
            I also volunteered previously during the summer of 2023 (in high school). I volunteered with patient and family
            experience. While there, I would help prepare events for the families of the patient and the patients themselves.
            Some skills I utilized were patient interaction, taking inventory, and setting up/taking down events. I would also help
            maintain the family center to make the patients and their families more comfortable. This included doing the laundry
            or patients and family, tidying the family area, and interacting with the families in the family area. I volunteer
            for three hours a day, once a week. <br>

            <h4 class="date3">Hours: 49</h3>
        <li class="desc3">Being a part of Alternative Breaks, I had the privilege to go on a weekend trip to volunteer in Tampa. More information
            about Alternative Breaks is available on the <a href="clubs.html">clubs</a> page. On this trip
            we went to Tampa, Florida from December 15, 2024, to December 18, 2024. On the 15th, we explored Tampa. 
            On the 16th, we volunteered with The Samaritans Purse. We helped make a woman's house livable after being
            devastated by Hurricane Milton. We did this by reinforcing windows to prevent water from getting into her home.
            I learned how to use some tools and equipment for home repair that I had never used before.
            This experience helped me learn that if I am more fortunate than others, 
            it does not take a lot of effort to help others who are not as fortunate. On the 17th, we volunteered with
            The Salvation Army. We helped prepare gifts for underprivileged families. We did this by sorting clothing for children by
            age and gender. We would try to match clothing and other items to what the people had asked for. 
            This experience helped me learn that
            I do not have to spend any money just to help people who do not have disposable cash. Spending money
            holds people back from helping their community, but it does not have to cost a single cent. <br>

        <h1>Cards for Kids</h1>
            <h4>Hours: 6</h3>
        <li>In the American Medical Student Association (AMSA) we had the opportunity to create cards for 
            terminally ill hospitalized children. This experience was honestly very touching. Not just because
            I knew the children would be happy to receive a card, but also because I knew their family would 
            cherish the moments they spent with their child receiving their card. This encouraged me to put in 
            real effort and creativity for a child I did not even know. I hope to do this more often in the future. <br>

        <li class="desc3">On multiple occasions I have volunteered with various departments of UHealth. I have 
            received community service hours with Sylvester Cancer Comprehensive Center for events like Susan G. Komen
            Cancer Walk and Dolphins Cancer Challenges. I have also received  community service hours from the Miller
            School of Medicine for events like eMerge, and from the Sports Medicine Institute for attending events like
            Student Leadership Day in 2024. At some of these events, like Susan G. Komen Cancer Walk and Dolphins Cancer Challenge,
            I help run the stand I am volunteering with. The stand usually has activities, handouts, and photo opportunities. 
            I help with handing
            out giveaways, running the activity, and interacting with the people that stop by the stand. At other
            events, like Student Leadership Day and eMerge, I received  hours just for attending and participating.<br>
