        <h1>American Medical Student Assosiation</h1>
            <h4>August 2024 - December 2024</h3>
        <li>I was the most active member of pre-med AMSA for the fall 2024 term at Florida International University. At AMSA students have 
            the oppurtunity to get community service hours, donate to various causes, attend countless medical school application events, 
            and get hands on experience with many medical trainings. I attended a phlebotomy workshop, CPR workshop, manual vacuum respiration
            workshop, suturing workshop and many other types of introductory training. The more events attended, the more points the members get. 
            I was a gold distinction member (the highest level recognized) with over 50 points for the term. This organization introduced me to so many
            medical experiences, showed me various oppurtuinites for pursing medicine and helped me give back to the community from school.

        <h1>Alternative Breaks</h1>
            <h4>October 2024 - March 2025</h3>
        <li>Alternative Breaks is an organization that takes their members on a short service trip during one of their breaks. I went to Tampa, Florida
            during the winter break of 2024. More information about the trip is available on the
            <a href="volunteer.html">volunteering</a> page. Outside of this trip, we had biweekly meetings from October
            2024 to March 2025. This organization taught us teamwork, responsibility, and leadership.

        <h1>Init</h1>
            <h4>Janurary 2025 - April 2025</h3>
        <li>Init is an organizations that teaches a general audience how to get started in coding. 
            At Init I learned basic techniques. Init is where I learned how to create this portfolio. We learned how to use HTML, CSS, and Javascript
            on a very basic level. We did two projects over the spring 2025 term. The first one was a Spotify Data Visualizer using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
            The second one was creating a personal portfolio (This website) using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
            I am adding more and more to this portfolio by using what I learned in the workshops. With Init I was also introduced to the world
            of technology and software engineering. I went to Women in Tech Conference 2025 (Witcon) and Demonstration Day for spring 2025.
            This showed me how computer science can be useful in a variety of areas and not strictly for software engineers.
