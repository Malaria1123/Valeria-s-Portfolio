        <h1>Bio3 Spring Forward Workshop</h1>
            <h4>Feburary 24, 2025 - Feburary 28, 2025</h3>
        <li>This workshop was a mix of career development and an intro to bioinformatics.<span class="ellipsis">...</span> <span class="hidden-text"></span> This workshop helped me prepare for creating resumes,
                CVs and portfolios. It also gave me an introduction to Jalview, IQ Tree, FigTree, PyMol, and Spyder. Outside of research and career development, 
                I also worked in a group and was able to take charge of my group a couple times. I was able to take instructions and to teach my peers. This workshop was 8
                hours for a full week which means I got 40 research hours out of it.
